"Dear Lloyds    The following is based on the core point that desperately needed climate action policy can be pitched no more strongly than that the supremely qualified body, now joined by the conservative International Energy Agency, ""NOAA"", warns there is no scope for expansion for fossil power.     It's a warning. Anything being carried on ""report"" even one of the IPCC falls short, diluting the role and seriousness of ""warning"", its binding effect.    All are bound by the impossible to displace warning referred to below.     Climate action policy is completely governed by a longstanding warning, that has stood issued for years.    In the heeding of the warning, warnings bind, to be heeded, there is only one outstanding matter, how it is to be heeded.    Rising emissions and failure of action for decades to heed, accounts for the escalating urgency.    There is no reason to bar apprising of the reason for a warning, but that never displaces a warning's binding to heed full stop.    Over mounting years, now, I have written to all who come to mind, in trying to escalate, way beyond well overdue, action required, on climate policy.     The point I am about to highlight is the strongest approach, which must be brought together in one voice, for we are all in the line of fire, efforts should be directed to this goal, of all bodies and MPs seeking this, now beyond, urgent progress.    Working networks to get the ""warning"" through should be bristling with this, to have the effect of ""red alert"".    There is a soaring authority on climate and weather, because of its workforce, the actual work it does, and vastly onerous responsibility - no other body or person rates.     The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, (""NOAA""), rightly of the US Dept. of Commerce, no less, is there for the protection of the US economy, no less, and warns, there is no scope for expansion of fossil - oil gas coal - full stop, end of story.     For any warning there is no threshold need to know of its background- it is dispensed with, irrelevant - the reason for it. Warnings stand alone, and bind.    NOAA relentlessly combs the oceans and atmosphere. One of a number of points that puts this warning authority above all, supreme.    Time for action could not be more pressing / urgent, is part of the warning.    Unfortunately, this endless, high priority, is given to ""report"", say of the IPCC.  ""Report"", conveys the idea of business-as-usual deliberation of climate.    Warnings bind to heed, there are no exemptions.     This is the achilles heel, of even those, like Matt Kean, of government in NSW, Australia, making reassuring noises, of action, when at the same time, the NSW government, for instance, is standing to approve new coal operations.     Madness.    Upon, then Australian Conservation Foundation head, Ian Lowe's presentation, 12 years ago, that people would be mistaken for looking for a dramatic linear trajectory of an Earth rising temperature, as it would be accumulating growth of recorded above average temperatures.    Since, familiar with the temperatures of the south east half of Australia, I have been casually taking note.    Increasingly, maximum and minimum outstrip average and below, the margin above, often quite great, while those, below, rarely so. Often, below average starts, to a day, will register above average maximum, truly worrying.     This has been marked, and so fast, talk of ""adapting"" is nonsense. Such a clear change in the temperatures that are tracked would unfold over countless generations for adaptability.    This extent of change, accelerating, is not adaptable, especially with the behemoth that the modern world is. It is very brittle, vulnerable. in this context.    The centralised systems that fossil require are, paradoxically, even more at risk by this feature.    It is tracking change, so fast, and growing, that it points to vast momentum, which makes the weightiness and fixedness of modern civilisation's structure, that less resilient.    So, it is no wonder that Australia goes ""ablaze"". Till 30 years ago, the aim of firefighting was to put them out.     Now, so ferocious, in such a short time, the idea is only to save many and as much property as possible.    Before 30 years ago there were bushfires usually towards the end of each every other, other Australian season.     Now wildfires, anytime, from August to May.     Of course, now, many parts of Earth, are out-of-control ablaze, per year.    Even average rainfall fails its role, to maintain ground/vegetation moisture, for, a not so long ago, mild, moist and temperate south eastern Australia, now quickly lost, is growing aridness.     Once, reliable and soaking gentle rain, is rare. Rain bursts, of dam openings, on a month's worth, measured in minutes, is common, with growing periods between, and of high runoff rate, leaving less for the ground to absorb, soak up, and subject to the drying effect of the rising number of above average temperatures.    The changed rain pattern is from the stronger water holding capacity of a warmer atmosphere.    This has taken place in a short 30 years.    And climate is still in great flux, far from where it will settle, as emissions continue to rise, which adds to the flux, for a heat holding capability of what is already there, has not been reached, despite the take up of renewables.     wishing you well, stay safe.

"Greta Thunberg aptly, poignantly described the global-warming (non)efforts of faux or neo-environmentalist politicos as just more ""blah, blah, blah"". To me, though, she was also saying that, while bone-dry-vegetation world regions uncontrollably burn, mass addiction to fossil fuel products undoubtedly helps keep the average consumer quiet about the planet‚Äôs greatest polluter, lest they feel and/or be publicly deemed hypocritical. Meanwhile, neoliberals and conservatives remain preoccupied with vocally criticizing one another for their relatively trivial politics and diverting attention away from some of the planet's greatest polluters, where it should and needs to be sharply focused.     Industry and fossil-fuel friendly governments can tell when a very large portion of the populace is too tired and worried about feeding/housing themselves or their family, and the virus-variant devastation still being left in COVID-19‚Äôs wake ‚Äî all while on insufficient income ‚Äî to criticize them for whatever environmental damage their policies cause/allow, particularly when not immediately observable. In fact, until recently, I had not heard Greta‚Äôs name in the mainstream corporate news-media since COVID-19 hit the world.     As individual consumers, far too many of us still recklessly behave as though throwing non-biodegradable garbage down a dark chute, or pollutants flushed down toilet/sink drainage pipes or emitted out of elevated exhaust pipes or spewed from sky-high jet engines and very tall smoke stacks ‚Äî even the largest toxic-contaminant spills in rarely visited wilderness ‚Äî can somehow be safely absorbed into the air, water, and land (i.e. out of sight, out of mind); like we‚Äôre inconsequentially dispensing of that waste into a black-hole singularity, in which it‚Äôs compressed into nothing.    I have long said that, collective human existence has been dangerously analogous to a cafeteria lineup consisting of diversely societally represented people, all adamantly arguing over which identifiable person should be at the front and, conversely, at the back of the line. Many of them further fight over to whom amongst them should go the last piece of quality pie and how much they should have to pay for it ‚Äî all the while the interstellar spaceship on which they‚Äôre all permanently confined, owned and operated by (besides the wealthiest passengers) the fossil fuel industry, is on fire and toxifying at locations not normally investigated. As a species, we really can be so heavily preoccupied with our own individual albeit often overwhelming little worlds, that we‚Äôll miss the biggest of pictures.","[49, -123]"

"Dear Sir or Madam  I understand that some coal mining firms wish to be insured with your members. Please may I suggest, this is not likely to be a good idea?  If they are insured then they will mine coal which will be burned. As a result, more carbon dioxide will be created and the Earth will become warmer. This will cause ice to melt and the sea level will rise. According to papers appearing on the US NASA web site, if all ice melts then the rise may be about 60 metres.  About 30 years ago, I crossed the Similaun Pass from Austria to Italy. The ice was melting then. I had to traverse across wet ice to reach the col. it was slippery. Since then, satellite photos of the col show it bare of ice and snow. This change of climate is happening. It is real.  This sea level rise is due to two processes. The first is melting of ice on land. That may cause sea level rise of about 40 metres. That may be enough to submerge the floor of the Cathedral nave here in Winchester where I live. It may also submerge Parliament Square.  The second process will be the warming of deep oceans which are now at 4 deg. C, the temperature at which water is densest.  If even only the first such process occurs then the insurance industry will be in chaos.  Yours sincerely.  Alan Hutchinson.","[51, 0]"

Some extreme weather events show ‚Äòtipping point‚Äô behaviour when a critical level of heat or drought triggers a massive, devastating event.  ‚Ä∫ In 2019-20, we ushered in a new and dangerous era of megafires that ravaged Australia, Brazil, Siberia and the US West Coast. During the massive Black Summer bushfires, we likely crossed a tipping point for Australia‚Äôs temperate broadleaf and mixed forests. In any typical fire season, 2-3 percent of these forests burn, but in the Black Summer 21 percent burned.  ‚Ä∫ Around half of all hard corals along the Great Barrier Reef perished during successive mass bleaching events in the past five years. We are on track to eliminate all of Australia‚Äôs and the world‚Äôs tropical coral reefs.      3  Ignoring climate change is deadly. Australians are now paying the price for our own and the world‚Äôs failure to reduce emissions quickly enough or deeply enough.  ‚Ä∫ Governments, like the Australian Government, which have failed to substantially reduce emissions over the past decade have sentenced Australians, and communities worldwide, to a far more dangerous future than if they had responded to repeated warnings from scientists.  ‚Ä∫ Due to this past inaction, gradual, measured steps are not enough to avoid catastrophe. At this point, only truly transformative action is required. That means at least halving global emissions over the coming decade, and reaching net zero emissions globally by 2040 at the latest.  4  No developed country has more to lose from climate change-fuelled extreme weather, or more to gain as the world transforms to a zero- carbon economy, than Australia does.  ‚Ä∫ We need bold, concerted action across all levels of government, business, industry and community to reduce Australia‚Äôs emissions to net zero as soon as possible, and prepare for worsening extreme weather events.  ‚Ä∫ Almost all of Australia‚Äôs major trading partners and strategic allies, as well as Australian state and territories, are now committed to net zero emissions by around mid-century. This includes countries that buy more than 70% of our coal and gas exports.  ‚Ä∫ Australia can position itself as a global powerhouse of renewable energy and clean industries, ensuring our prosperity and security in a post-carbon world.","[-38, 145]"

"I consider myself fortunate to live in the Western Cape of South Africa, with its historically mild climate and areas of natural beauty and diversity that draws visitors from across the globe. But things are changing: weather patterns are becoming more extreme, and this change is happening at an increasing pace, such that we (and our environment) are unable to adapt quickly enough to keep up.     Just three years ago our land was gripped by a terrible drought, water was strictly rationed, and we lived in real fear that our taps would run dry and be shut off - in fact, that actually did happen in more remote towns: bottled water had to be trucked in to keep people alive. Farmers were losing livestock and crops at an alarming rate.    Two year after that, some parts of the country experienced record flooding; again lives and homes and crops were lost.    Less than a week ago we had temperatures reaching 35 degrees Celsius, a few days later the temperature dropped and we had heavy rains, today it was awfully hot again, but in a couple of days there's a forecast of snow in the mountains. This isn't normal. It's scary.    We ALL need to do everything we can to protect our planet before it's too late.

You're killing the small bear and wolf population, who rely on the salmon and forest for survival. You're killing our tourism, and the reason so many people think of my province's name as ""Beautiful"" before they've even said the words.     Please stop funding and insuring climate chaos, and the companies openly committing Ecocide on a daily basis. Business as usual must change today.

"I am 61 years old. My whole life, I have been active outdoors, skiing, camping, hiking, travelling widely through wilderness in Australia and several countries overseas. I have been a keen gardener with backyard vegies, herbs and flowers for 40 years, ever aware of the climate year by year. Even in the late '80s when I was working in Sweden, they were remarking on the warmest summer they had experienced in centuries, and the climate changes they had witnessed in their lifetimes. In Israel where I worked in the early '80s, they were lamenting the loss of water in the iconic Jordan river (now a puddle), and drying of the Dead Sea, partly due to over-extraction but also due to climate changes in the headwaters.     These are climate processes that people around the planet have been recording for 50 years or more, there can be no dispute about that, nor about the corroborating scientific data that has been gathered over that time. What the data increasingly shows is that these profound climate shifts are due to human activity, namely the release of increasing amounts of CO2, methane, and other gases. Fossil fuels are the most glaring culprit, and one of the easiest to ameliorate. Much of the world is already following this path, and most will follow as the global mindset shifts. The ""dinosaurs"" (as our Australian government is often called) will go extinct in this new world. This is absolutely inevitable.     I know humans are such that there will always be those who will seek to benefit monetarily from whatever happens, like with covid and the companies that have made huge profits throughout. It has been widely remarked that the very rich have been untouched by covid. This while many others lose their homes, careers, businesses and loved ones. Is Lloyds that sort of company? Are your staff those sort of people? Who fiddle while Rome burns? Who sacrifice conscience for their bonuses? These people exist, of course. But do you want to employ them? Be identified with them? Have your commercial image tarnished by them? Do you have children? Grandchildren? What sort of world will you bequeath to them? How honest can you be with them? With yourselves?     In Melbourne, I lived through the '83 bushfires which completely ringed the city, a firefront over 100s of kilometers. Living in the suburbs, we could see the flames in the Dandenong Ranges on our horizon. We had burning leaves fall from the sky into our yard. That seemed cataclysmic. The fires of Black summer in 2020, just before the covid outbreak, really seemed the end of the world. The smoke and ash in the atmosphere even in our big cities was choking, and had not been seen for many lifetimes. Thousands lost their homes, millions of animals died horrible deaths and undoubtedly some went extinct. Countless lives were forever changed.    As a scientist, I know the data and how to read it. I also know how to read what's been happening in my environment in my lifetime, and it's wrong. The 1% that are so far untouched by the changes will answer for their actions, and will not continue, will not be permitted to. History has shown that repeatedly.    In this new world, companies will be expected to work for everyone, not just the 1%. The rest will die off, if they do not change their mindset and business ethos. Use of fossil fuels must stop now. We have alternatives, and their development will progress faster the more we turn to them. Financing of fossil businesses does not make economic nor moral sense.     I won't even say 'please'. It is not a matter of politeness to remove yourselves from fossil fuel investments, but of urgent global necessity. The writing has been on the wall for decades now, and activism like this should no longer be necessary. But it is, due to companies like Lloyds that continue to follow the old wheel ruts, that lead to oblivion.  ","[-38, 145]"

The oceanic current that stabilizes Europes climate to a moderate and fairly warm climate is already slowing due to the lighter less salty water from melted polar ice. This is even more worrying for me and should be for every European as it will change our climate strongly with longer draughts, longer and more intense rain falls as well as hotter and longer heat waves in the summer. This will have a direct impact on our lives in Europe. From lower crops and shortages of water to more damage from this extreme wheather and extinction of vurnerable species.   We all have a responsibility to act. To use less fuel, to eat less meat and to help the transfer to a sustainable future for all humans. Therefore, I urge you to take your responsibility to my and your children to invest in green alternatives instead of investing in more fossil fuels that have caused all these problems and as we speak are still increasing the problems.

My friends in Australia experienced the forest fires that destroyed precious wildlife over a vast area. The Arctic ice is melting at an alarming rate while drought-stricken landlocked areas are growing ever larger.  It is, beyond all possible doubt, the burning of fossil fuels that contributes the most to global warming.

It cannot really be good business sense to provide insurance against what is going to be a certain disaster if climate change continues at the current rate.

"Dears sirs and madams,  I am still struggling with the question why highly educated and well informed people, still do not take required action to turn the climate change around. I think all of the people in power at Lloyds have an academic background and the ability to judge the scientific evidence for man-made climate change.   Besides this, I cannot understand how parents, which some of you undoubtedly are, can explain to their children why they did nothing when they had huge opportunities to play a leading role in ensuring their future.   But I am also an optimist. Thirty years ago only ""silly lefties"" warned for man-made climate change. Now it is discussed and accepted in all the major international organisations that it is a fact and imediate action is at the utmost importance.   Therefor I am convinced that also at Lloyds common sense will prevail in the end. Hopefully it is not too late.    Yours sincerely,  Eveline van Deventer, The Hague, Netherlands ","[52, 4]"

Scientists have long warned us about the dangers to our planet caused by human exploitation of the earth's resources, particularly by the burning of fossil fuels, and it is inexplicable to me to understand why such an erstwhile reputable and long-lived company such as Lloyds is continuing to insure ( or has not yet ruled out insuring ) huge coal mining companies seeking to dig new mines.  I imagine that many of your company are parents and grandparents, and it is the latter for whom I am particularly concerned, innocent children who will inherit a  mortally wounded world which it will be their job to try to heal in order just to survive. Surely this is not what you want for future generations, and in the end, however much money is made from these insurance contracts, it will not be able to save you, me, humanity or all other life on the planet from eventual extinction, with terrible suffering in the process.  I beg of you to think again and to reject insuring any projects which will further endanger humanity and our amazingly beautiful diverse earth which cannot be replaced by any man made insurance company.
