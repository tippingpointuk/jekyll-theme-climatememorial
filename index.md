    # Remember. Resist. Rise.

    ## Climate Memorial

    Through this memorial we will bring to life the memories of every person harmed by the injustices of the climate crisis. We’ve  laid wreaths naming climate wrecking projects we want Lloyd’s of London to rule out underwriting, and help to prevent billions of lives being destroyed by climate impacts. Lloyd’s needs to stop ignoring the climate science and communities being effected by climate breakdown. Thousands of people across the world have messages - join the memorial.
